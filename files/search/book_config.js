The Korean Pine nuts are \u000d\u000amost commonly found in US \u000d\u000astores, with Mongolia producing \u000d\u000amost of the supply.\u000d\u000aPine nuts, like many tree nuts, are \u000d\u000aa great source of B vitamins and \u000d\u000aprotein, and they add a nutritious \u000d\u000acrunch and flavor to salads, sauces, \u000d\u000abreads and desserts alike. Toasting \u000d\u000apine nuts develops a deeper, more \u000d\u000acomplex nutty flavor and crunch. \u000d\u000aYou can do this yourself by placing \u000d\u000athe pine nuts in a dry, hot, cast \u000d\u000airon skillet or uncoated saut\u00e9 pan \u000d\u000aover medium heat, being sure to \u000d\u000akeep the nuts moving until evenly \u000d\u000abrowned.

Mechanical pressing of \u000d\u000aolives produces the best tasting oils.\u000d\u000aEXTRA VIRGIN - When a virgin \u000d\u000aolive oil is described as being \u000d\u000a\u201cextra,\u201d it indicates that the oil is \u000d\u000aa superior or premium virgin oil, \u000d\u000ausually from the first mechanical \u000d\u000apressing of the olives. The quality \u000d\u000astandards for extra virgin are the \u000d\u000asame as virgin oils. \u000d\u000aCold-pressed and First ColdPress - These are redundant \u000d\u000aterms used to further explain what \u000d\u000avirgin means. In order for an olive \u000d\u000aoil to be labeled as \u201cvirgin\u201d it must \u000d\u000abe extracted by mechanical means \u000d\u000awithout the addition of heat.
